# Puppy Love

A web application disguised as a dog photo/video sharing application, but designed to promote dog adoption/rescue.

* A user can post and view dog pictures/videos.
* A user can click on the heart under a post to "love" the post.
* A user can click on "I Want One!" under a post to connect with adoption/rescue groups across the country that have dogs, which match the breed of the dog in the photo/video, available for adoption.
