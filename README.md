# Puppy Love

A single page application disguised as a dog photo/video sharing application, but designed to promote dog adoption/rescue.

* A user can post and view dog pictures/videos.
* A user can filter posts by dog breed.
* A user can click on a post's 'heart' to *love* the post.
* A user can click on a post's 'I Want One!' button to view adoptable dogs of the same breed as the dog in the post.
* A user can scroll through the adoptable dogs' photos & information and click on a link to learn more about adopt that dog.
